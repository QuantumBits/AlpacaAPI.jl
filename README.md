## The Julia Alpaca API Wrapper

AlpacaAPI.jl is a wrapper built entirely in Julia for [Alpaca, the modern platform for algorithmic trading](https://alpaca.markets/docs/api-documentation/api-v2/).

Currently a work in progress, and as I am merely a single devleoper working in my free time this project might take a little while.
